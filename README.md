# README

Ola Amigos, this is a much awaited learning project by me, where I made a Blogging website from scratch using the Ruby on rails platform

to run this, download Ruby on rails from- railsinstaller.org

complete the setup and run rails server using 
rails s
on git bash in windows

place the project in your Sites folder.
